# Nexus
nexus is a schizophrenic feverdream i had for syncing players between minecraft lobby servers in different continents

it barely works, please do not use this except for testing

bugs include:
players randomly turn into fire, 
horrible desync, 
the entire design of this project could be considered one big bug,
clone position will not update unless there are 2+ players on the original server due to the stupid entity tracker,
lettuce fuckery due to netty version despite newer netty version being shaded into the jar it WILL NOT WORK unless you use pandaspigot i wish i could tell you why

FOR SOME REASON IT CREATED A 900GB FILE AND CRASHED THE ENTIRE BRIDGE SCRIMS NETWORK!! DO NOT USE THIS

have fun
